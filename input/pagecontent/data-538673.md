**DRAFT-NOT FOR CLINICAL USE**

A medication resource is available for each of the seven main NZMT concepts.  See NZMT data model for more details.


### NZMT Medicine code

All medication resources have a unique NZMT ID (see <a href="./nzmt-datamodel.html#nzmt-id-details">NZMT Data model - ID details</a>).  This is used as the ID for a medication as well as being the first code listed in the medication.code

#### Usage details

**Example FHIR Data**
```
"code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://nzmt.org.nz",
        "code": "10037191000116105",
        "display": "paracetamol"
      }
    ]
  }
```

**Example Queries**

The simplist way to retrieve an individual medicine resource is via the id
>[base]/Medication/44282231000116104

Medications are also available via the code field which returns a bundle
>[base]/Medication?code=http://nzmt.org.nz|44282231000116104

### NZMT Concept Type

In order to identify what type of NZMT concept a particular medicine is there is an extension call nzf-nzmt-type.  This not only allows for concept identification but there is also a custom search parameter which allows for retrieval based on a particular type.

The types allowed are - mp, mpp, mpuu, tp, tpp, tpuu, ctpp

#### Usage details

**Example FHIR Data**
```

    "url": "http://hl7.org.nz/fhir/StructureDefinition/nzf-nzmt-type",
    "valueCodeableConcept": {
    "coding": [
        {
        "system": "https://standards.digital.health.nz/ns/nzmt-type-code",
        "code": "mp"
        }
    ]
    }
}
```

**Example Queries**

To retrieve all MPUUs using the custom search parameter (nzf-nzmt-type)
>[base]/Medication?nzf-nzmt-type=https://standards.digital.health.nz/ns/nzmt-type-code|mpuu

Note - it is possible to query without the system but for performance reasons it is not recommended
>[base]/Medication?nzf-nzmt-type=mpuu

Custom search parameter - <a href="./notes.html#custom-search-parameters">see details</a>

### Status

MP, TP, MPP, TPP, MPUU, TPUU and substances are deemed inactive if they are either duplicates, known to be obsolete, replaced by another entry (possibly due to error) or products that have been rebranded

A CTPP medication is deemed active if it is not deemed obsolete (as above) and the following criteria is met:
- Has some level of community funding or HML funding for any of the schedules associated with the medication (i.e. current or future)
- Is unapproved (i.e. section 29)
- Has no medsafe nzmt link
- Medsafe status is either "Active" or "Under Assessment" and Medsafe regSituation is either "Consent given" or "Provisional consent"

#### Usage details

**Example FHIR Data**

```
"status": "inactive",
```

**Examples Queries**

### Concept relationships

As explained in the <a href="./nzmt-datamodel.html">NZMT data model</a> the various NZMT concepts have various relationships to each other.  To model these relationships there is a extension called nzf-related-medication and a related custom search parameter.  This models the direct relationships, as shown in the datamodel, and also has some convenience links as well.  

All medications will have one or more nzf-related-medication links to its applicable MPs.

<p>The following table shows the related medications for each concept</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td>Concept</td>
<td>Related medications</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>CTPP</td>
    <td>MP<br/>TPP<br/>TPUU<br/>MPUU</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>MPP</td>
    <td>MP<br/>MPUU (1 or more)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>MPUU</td>
    <td>MP<br>MPP (1 or more)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>TPP</td>
    <td>MP<br/>TP<br/>TPUU (1 or more)<br/>MPP</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>TPUU</td>
    <td>MP<br/>TP<br>TPP (1 or more)<br>MPUU</td>
</tr>
</table>

These relationships can be used after retrieving individual medication resources or for queries via the custom search parameter

### NZMT Descriptions

Each medication always have a preferred term and a fully specified name description.

A description is a text expression related to a Concept ID.  Each of these descriptions has a SNOMED CT description ID of its own, in addition to the SNOMED CT Concept ID to which it is related.  The primary descriptions are the FullySpecifiedName and PreferredTerm but this table includes other variant Terms or names for a substance or product.  There are number of types of descriptions including Label Names, Pharmac-specific names and Prescribing Terms (see 3.5.7 for more details).

These may exist for a number of reasons. For example, some substances have very long names (Preferred Terms) but a label on a bottle only has room for 40 characters, so an alternate name of type “label” may need to be created. This would be done by a pharmacist, and would involve sensibly condensing a long name down to something that it still precise and meaningful in 40 characters or less. This will usually involve the use of common abbreviations.

There are number of possible descriptions in addition to the FullySpecifiedName and PreferredTerm including: 
- Label names (up to 40, 80 and 160 characters long)
- Blister pack names (12 characters long)
- Pharmac-specific names
- Prescribing Terms (up to 200 characters long)
- Charting Terms (up to 100 characters long)
- Synonyms (up to 1000 characters long)
- CVX vaccine identifiers (up to 20 characters long)

#### Prescribing Terms

The Prescribing Terms description now has entries at the MPUU, MPP, TPUU and TPP level.  These entries are designed to provide a standard shorter abbreviation (200 characters instead of 1000 characters) for lengthy Preferred Terms.  While the field is 200 characters in length, in practice we have reduced the length of Prescribing Terms to 120 characters.  Where a Prescribing Term exists, we expect it to be used as a display term in preference to the Preferred Term in prescribing systems.  In the absence of a generic Prescribing Term, where a shortened name is needed, the MPUU PT is to be used.

Note that an MPUU or MPP record that has the prescribe-by-brand flag set does not have a generic Prescribing Term and the MPUU or MPP PreferredTerm should not be used as a generic Prescribing Term.  For these generics, the Trade Prescribing Term is the only Prescribing Term to be used.

#####	Sort Names

The Sort Names description now has entries at the CTPP and MPUU level.  These entries are designed to support sorting the text Preferred Terms into ascending order by strength and unit dose.  They have only been added where required, and where they do not exist the Preferred Term is used to sort for text-based sorting of the records.  Note that the sort we use includes the dose form as a separate element and so the Sort Name is intended only to provide the correct ascending sequence for a given dose form.

#####	Synonyms

The Synonyms description now has entries at the MP and substance level.  These entries are designed to support searching for alternate names for medicines and so are currently only found at MP and substance level.

#####	Dispensing Terms

The Dispensing Term descriptions come in two types: 80-character Label Names and 40-character Label Names.  These two description types now have entries at the MPUU, MPP, TPUU, TPP and CTPP level (as of release 2.8.6.0).  These entries are designed to provide a standard shorter abbreviation (80 and 40 characters instead of 1000 characters) for lengthy Preferred Terms.  In practice we have limited the 80-character terms to 76 characters and the 40-character terms to 36 characters to enable vendors to prefix the label with the number of units of use and suffix the label with a plural if required.  All Dispensing Terms are singular to allow for consistency in their application.

Unlike the Prescribing Terms, we have included Dispensing Terms for ‘virtual’ CTPP records.  These are necessarily at CTPP level and are effectively trade dispensing terms.

Note that the ‘prescribe_by_brand’ flag at MPUU or MPP level does not affect Dispensing Terms.  All products that are not virtual CTPPs should have generic Dispensing Terms.

#####	Charting Terms

The Charting Terms description now has entries at the MPUU, MPP, TPUU and TPP level.  These entries are designed to provide a standard shorter abbreviation (100 characters instead of 1000 characters) for lengthy Preferred Terms.  These terms were specifically intended for use in hospital electronic charting systems.  Where a Charting Term exists, we expect it to be used as a display term in preference to the Preferred Term in such systems.  In the absence of a generic Prescribing Term, where a shortened name is needed, the MPUU PT is to be used.

Note that unlike the Prescribing Term an MPUU or MPP record that has the prescribe-by-brand flag set does have a generic Charting Term and the MPUU or MPP PreferredTerm should be used as a generic Charting Term where required.  Another variation from the Preferred Term and the Prescribing is that the trade Charting Terms do not include details of the generic ingredients of the product.

#####	LBL160 Terms

Hospital clinicians were concerned about the level of abbreviation in the LBL80 label terms where these were used for internal hospital labels.  Accordingly, we now provide an LBL160 label which has dose forms (for example) no longer abbreviated as a matter of course.  These label terms are designed to provide a standard shorter abbreviation (160 characters instead of 1000 characters) for lengthy Preferred Terms for use in hospital pharmacy systems.
Note that an MPUU or MPP record that has the prescribe-by-brand flag set still has a generic LBL160 Term.

#####	Tallman Lettering Terms

There are three terms intended to provide alternate descriptions using Tallman Lettering, as recommended by the Health Quality and Safety Commission.  There are alternates to the Preferred Term, the Prescribing Term and the Charting Term, and are intended to allow for safer selection of medicine through the use of the Tallman Lettering convention. For substance, MP and TP the alternate TallMan terms are all alternates to the PreferredTerm.  For MPUU, TPUU, MPP and TPP the alternate TallMan terms are alternates to the Charting Term and the Prescribing Term.

#####	CVX Vaccine IDs

This term is the American CVX vaccine code. Initially the codes for Covid-19 are supplied. Over time this will be extended to include other vaccines. This alternate description exists to provide an additional method of searching for specific vaccines. We are unsure as to whether or not multiple codes may apply, so it is possible that more than one code is present for a given NZMT record. These codes are linked to MP and TP records.


These descriptions are added to each medication resource via the nzf-description extension.  This extension contains two fields, firstly the type of the description and secondly the description term.

There is also a custom search parameter on the preferred-term allowing for normal FHIR search based expressions - [see FHIR search documentation](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/search.html#string)

### Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification Codes

CTPP, TPP, TPUU, MPP, MPUU and MP medications can be linked to one or more ATC codes.  

Note that not all medications are linked.  There are, for example a number of items in the NZMT that simply don’t have an ATC code (particularly in the area of devices) because they do not fall within the coverage of the ATC system.  In addition, we chose not to add an ATC link to the MPUU and TPUU records for inert substances (diluents and similar) to avoid the potential for user confusion.

This is modelled via the nzf-atc code extension.

### GTINs

GTINs are GS1 Global Trade Identification Numbers. They are the most common type of barcode / number found on all kinds of products.

GS1 regulations require a new GTIN every time the product formulation or packaging changes, so there may be more than one GTIN for a given CTPP (physical product pack), in which case there will be a code for each GTIN. 

These code(s) are added as codes in the medication code field

**Example FHIR Data**

```
"code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://nzmt.org.nz",
        "code": "50066481000117107",
        "display": "Paracetamol (Amcal) orange 250 mg/5 mL oral liquid: suspension, 200 mL, bottle"

### SNOMED CT Mappings

Where applicable mappings are available the SNOMED CT MP Products have been mapped to NZMT MPs.  

These codes are added as a code in the medication code field

**Example FHIR Data**

```
"code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://nzmt.org.nz",

  }
```

**Examples Queries**

>[base]/Medication?code=http://snomed.info/sct|90332006

### Legal Classifications

Legal classifications, provided by medsafe, are primarily added to CTPPs via the nzf-legalclass extension.  However, for convenience, the legal classification extension is also added to TPUU and MPUU where all the related CTPPs have the same legal classification.

See [here for a list of possible values](CodeSystem-medicine-classification-code.html)

Note - medsafe also provide classifications at the substance level.  This has been added against MPs where applicable using the nzf-legalclass extension.  

Note that products unmapped to Medsafe (and therefore not considered registered) should only use this MP/Substance classification data where the classification is as a ‘Controlled Drug’ - as the Misuse of Drugs Act is separate from the Medicines Act and applies regardless of whether the sponsor has registered the product or not. Any other classification (General Sale, Prescription etc) requires the product to be registered and so these classifications are not appropriate to be used for unregistered products.

### Monographs / Monograph Links

Every monograph in the both the Adult and Childrens formularies has a DocumentReference.  These references contain a url link to the respective monographs on the nzf.org.nz and nzfchildren.org.nz websites. 

Every medication that is contained in a monograph, both adults and children has a link to its associated monograph(s).  This is done via the nzf-link extension which links to the DocumentReference(s) for the monograph.

**Example FHIR Data**

Url contained in monograph document reference

### Subsidy Information

<h3>Subsidy information</h3>

<p>Subsidy information is added to Containered Trade Product Packs where applicable.  The funding information is derived from both the PHARMAC community schedule as well as the HML.</p>
<p>There are two extensions added that store this information.  The first is <b>nzf-funding</b>.  This stores the general information around funding for a specific product, including some of the community schedule details (price etc.) - <a href="./StructureDefinition-nzf-funding.html">see extension details for more information</a> To cater for the existence of multiple schedules this extension can be added to a product multiple times, once per schedule - to make it easy to determine which schedules are available we provide a metadata resource, see example queries for more info.  This allows vendors to see both the current schedule information as well as an upcoming schedule.  To determine which set of information to use the 'scheduleDate' field can be used.  The second extension is <b>nzf-funding-rule</b>.  This extension once again has a schedule date so vendors can determine which schedule they would like to look at.  The purpose of this extension is to provide the PHARMAC funding rules that apply to the given product.  Most of the data here comes from the ps_rule table (in the NZMT releases) however a number of attribute rules are also added.  These are:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
