ADR – adverse drug reaction
alert—the display of a warning at the time of making or planning a health intervention, produced by a clinical decision support system (cf. warning, see interruptive, workflow and on demand alert)
alert group – a medicine group that is used for triggering common group alerts
ATC  –  Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical classification system. The WHO ATC codes are often referred to simply as ATC codes.
background medicines –  medicines that the patient is taking or has taken in the past (cf. foreground medicines)
BNF – British National Formulary
BNFC – British National Formulary for Children
CALs – Cautionary and Advisory Labels
causative agent – the medicine, substance, or medicine group that causes an adverse reaction (cf. trigger product)
clinical reference data—provides clinical recommendations at the core data level, such as advisory and warning labels and information about drug interactions. This data is available from the NZF CRD (Clinical Reference Data) tables. This is core data that supports prescribing and dispensing dialogs. (cf. medicines reference data and guidance data)
CMI – Consumer Medicines Information, usually a pamphlet of information to be given to consumers at the point of prescribing or dispensing
CMS – content management system
combination medicine – medicine with more than one formulation in a pack, more than one type of device in a pack, or a mix of medicine and device in a pack. e.g. levonorgestrel 50 microgram + ethinyloestradiol 30 microgram tablet [18 tablets] (&) levonorgestrel 75 microgram + ethinyloestradiol 40 microgram tablet [15 tablets] (&) levonorgestrel 125 microgram + ethinyloestradiol 30 microgram tablet [30 tablets] (&) inert substance tablet [21 tablets], 84 [3 x 28 tablets] (cf. compound and simple medicines)

common group alerting—a method for generating alerts based on the clinician recording a warning using the medicine as causative agent (cf. drug group alerting)
compound medicine – medicine with two or more active ingredients, with one formulation in a pack e.g. paracetamol 500 mg + metoclopramide 5 mg tablet, 60 tablets(cf. combination and simple medicine)
comprehensive interactions check – an interaction check that looks for all interactions between existing and prescribed medicines (cf. focussed interactions check)
CSS – Cascading Style Sheet, a document that specifies the styling of a web page
CSV – Comma Separated Values, a file format for exporting and import of data tables
CTPP – Containered Trade Product Pack; an NZMT concept reflecting a brand pack and its contents, including details of the container.
dampening – the withholding of potentially unnecessary alerts in a decision support system (see no-action dampening and topical dampening)

drug group alerting—a method for generating alerts based on the clinician recording a warning using the drug group as causative agent (cf. common group alerting)
eTG – electronic Therapeutic Guidelines; a product of Therapeutic Guidelines Lid of Australia
focussed interactions check – an interaction check that looks only for interactions of the foreground medicines with the background medicines (cf. comprehensive interactions check)
foreground medicines – the medicines actually being prescribed, dispensed, or administered, or medicines being evaluated for treating a patient (cf. background medicines)
GTIN – Global Trade Item Number, an identifier for trade items developed by GS1, basically a barcode number
guidance data—provides written information on approved indications, cautions, contra-indications, adverse effects, dose, patient advice (monographs), and general advice around the use of medicines for treating diseases and the use of particular pharmacological groups and classes (therapeutic notes).
interruptive alert — an alert typically an alert box that is drawn over the background of the workflow screen, and requires a specific action to confirm and remove it, often a mouse click (cf workflow and on demand alert)
LAN – Local Area Network, the usual term for a company or enterprise computer network
medicines reference data—provides information on availability, subsidies, classification, price, approved route of administration, active ingredients, synonyms, preferred terms, and SCTID codes. This information facilitates prescribing and dispensing decisions when the prescriber’s intention (medicine and dose) is already known. This data is available from the NZULM database tables. This is core data that drives prescribing and dispensing dialogs.
MP – Medicinal Product; an NZMT concept reflecting the generic medicine
MPP – Medicinal Product Pack; an NZMT concept reflecting a generic pack and its contents expressed in generic terms
MPUU – Medicinal Product Unit of Use; an NZMT concept reflecting a specific formulation of a generic medicine
no-action dampening – the withholding of Stockelys alerts that recommend no action (alerts that confirm there is a basis for the assertion that there is no interaction) (cf. topical dampening)
NZF – New Zealand Formulary
NZFc – New Zealand Formulary for Childern
NZMT – New Zealand Medicines Terminology, part of the NZULM
NZULM – New Zealand Universal List of Medicines
on demand alert — an alert typically in a report that is specifically requested by the user, for example, a poly-pharmacy safety report, an interactions report, a CVD risk assessment report (cf. interruptive and workflow alerting)
overalerting—when too many alerts are delivered, resulting in clinicians either missing important alerts, or disabling the alert facility altogether
Pharmacode – a unique identifier of pharmaceuticals within NZ, an integer up to 9 digits long
SCTID – SNOMED Clinical Terms Identifier; a 19 digit number used in the NZMT; SNOMED is the system used for allocating these identifiers, and ensuring that they are unique across the world.
simple medicine – medicine with one active ingredient, with one formulation in a pack (or device with one type of device in a pack) e.g. paracetamol 500 mg tablet, 50 tablets (cf. compound and combination medicine)
SNOMED – Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine

topical dampening – the withholding of interaction alerts between a topical medicine and a systemic medicine in a decision support system (cf. no-action dampening)

TPUU – Trade Product Unit of Use; an NZMT concept reflecting a specific formulation of a brand medicine
trigger product – the medicine under consideration that triggers an alert (cf. causative agent)
virtual product – a CTPP in the NZMT that has no TPP or any other concept. These are used for funding codes, not actual products.
