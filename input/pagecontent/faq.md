**How do I access the data?**
> You can request access to the fhir server by emailing fhir @ nzformulary.org

**We currently receive the monthly downloads from the NZULM or use data from the NZ Formulary, do we need to change to this API?**
> The goal is for this FHIR API to eventually become the primary source of distribution for NZF/NZULM data.  We understand however that, at least initially, not all data is available by the API and that many vendors have significant investments using some of the older distributions methods.  We do ask however that for any new developments you seriously consider using the FHIR API and if there are any issues, or missing data, please let us know.

**I have questions about either using the API or about the data, how do I get help?**
> If you email fhir @ nzformulary.org we will endevour to help you.  We want to make this Implementation Guide the primary source of documentation so we will be frequently updating these pages to fill in any documentation gaps we have.

**How often is the data updated?**
> We are aiming to make this as close to real-time as possible, so when a new medication is released then it should be available with the API shortly afterwards.

**We don't want to rely on an external API, can we cache the data?**
> We certainly understand that every use case is different and local caching maybe a requirement.  There is no reason why this can't be done and your cache updated whenever you need to.
