### Core NZMT Data

A medication resource is available for each of the seven main NZMT concepts.  See NZMT data model for more details.


#### Medicine code

All medication resources have a unique NZMT ID (see <a href="./nzmt-datamodel.html#nzmt-id-details">).  This is used as the ID for a medication as well as being the first code listed in the medication.code

##### Examples

The simplist way to retrieve an individual medicine resource is via the id
>[base]/Medication/44282231000116104

Medications are also available via the code field which returns a bundle
>[base]/Medication?code=http://nzmt.org.nz|44282231000116104
