This IG is to support retrieving formulary and medication information in New Zealand. This is part of a project by the NZULM/NZ Formulary to provide the information we produce and collate in a standards-based form. As an organisation we want to make it as easy as possible to retrieve the medication information that you require in a timely manner.

The key resource for this implementation is the Medication resource. For those that are familiar with the New Zealand Medicines Terminology (NZMT) we will provide a medication resource for the key types of medications in the NZMT. These are:

- Medicinal Product (MP) e.g. paracetamol
- Trade Product (TP) e.g. panadol
- Medicinal Product Unit of Use (MPUU) e.g. paracetamol 500 mg tablet
- Trade Product Unit of Use (TPUU) e.g. Panadol (paracetamol 500 mg) tablet: film-coated, 1 tablet
- Containered Trade Product Pack (CTPP) e.g. Panadol 500 mg tablet: film-coated, 1000 tablets, blister pack
- Medicinal Product Pack (MPP) e.g. paracetamol 120 mg/5 mL oral liquid, 200 mL
- Trade Product Pack (TPP) e.g. Panadol 500 mg tablet: film-coated, 12 tablets

The standard Medication resource provides the key information needed for integration however we have defined several extensions to allow for the addition of specific NZULM/Formulary information. The following table describes these extensions and shows which extensions apply to which medication type.

The medication resources will also link to several documents (using the link extension). To facilitate this, we use [DocumentReference](http://hl7.org/fhir/documentreference.html) resources.

We provide document references for the following data:

<table class="table table-bordered">

    <th>Data</th>
    <th>Description</th>

<tr>
    <td>Adult monographs</td>
    <td>A reference to all adult monographs - this allows for integrating systems to determine which monograph(s) to link to for a given medication</td>

    <td>A reference to all children monographs - this allows for integrating systems to determine which monograph(s) to link to for a given medication</td>

<h3>Medication code</h3>

<p>All medications will have a nzmt code.  Where applicable one or more PharmacodesÂ® will be added to a CTPP.  Where applicable one or more GTIN codes will added to a CTPP or a TPUU</p>

<h3>Subsidy information</h3>

<p>Subsidy information is added to Containered Trade Product Packs where applicable.  The funding information is derived from both the PHARMAC community schedule as well as the HML.</p>
<p>There are two extensions added that store this information.  The first is <b>nzf-funding</b>.  This stores the general information around funding for a specific product, including some of the community schedule details (price etc.) - <a href="./StructureDefinition-nzf-funding.html">see extension details</a> To cater for the existence of multiple schedules this extension can be added to a product multiple times, once per schedule.  This allows vendors to see both the current schedule information as well as an upcoming schedule.  To determine which set of information to use the 'scheduleDate' field can be used.  The second extension is <b>nzf-funding-rule</b>.  This extension once again has a schedule date so vendors can determine which schedule they would like to look at.  The purpose of this extension is to provide the PHARMAC funding rules that apply to the given product.  Most of the data here comes from the ps_rule table (in the NZMT releases) however a number of attribute rules are also added.  These are:</p>
