This IG is to support retrieving formulary and medication information in New Zealand.  

This is part of a project by the NZULM/NZ Formulary to provide the information we produce and collate in a standards-based form.  As an organisation we want to make it as easy as possible to retrieve the medication information that you require in a timely manner.

The key resource for this implementation is the Medication resource.  For those that are familiar with the New Zealand Medicines Terminology (NZMT) we will provide a medication resource profile for the key types of medications in the NZMT.  

These are:

* Medicinal Product Unit of Use (MPUU) e.g. paracetamol 500 mg tablet
* Trade Product Unit Of Use (TPUU) e.g. Panadol (paracetamol 500 mg) tablet: film-coated, 1 tablet
* Container Trade Product Pack (CTPP) e.g. Panadol 500 mg tablet: film-coated, 1000 tablets, blister pack
* Medicinal Product Pack (MPP) e.g. paracetamol 120 mg/5 mL oral liquid, 200 mL
* Trade Product Pack (TPP) e.g. Panadol 500 mg tablet: film-coated, 12 tablets


We will also provide a list of Medicinal Products (MP - e.g. Paracetamol) and Trade Products (TP - e.g. Panadol) as value sets.
The standard Medication resource provides the key information needed for integration however we have defined several extensions to allow for the addition of specific NZULM/Formulary information such as legal classifications and Pharmac funding details. 

We want this to be as useful as possible so please get in touch if you have any feedback.
